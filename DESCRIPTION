Description: A fast, optimal, and reproducible circular clustering
 algorithm called FOCC. It finds optimal clusters on circular data.
 Its runtime is O(K N log^2 N), where K is the number of clusters and
 N is the number of circular data points. On a desktop computer using
 a single processor core, millions of circular data points can be
 clustered within seconds. The FOCC algorithm is a first general
 high-performance solution to circular data clustering, applicable to
 characterizing events along circular genomes of bacteria,
 chloroplast, and mitochondria.
