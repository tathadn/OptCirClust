Description: Fast, optimal, and reproducible circular and framed data
 clustering algorithms. The runtime of the circular clustering
 algorithm is O(K N log^2 N), where K is the number of clusters and N
 is the number of circular data points. On a desktop computer using a
 single processor core, millions of circular data points can be
 clustered within seconds. One can use it to characterize
 events along circular DNA molecules, circular RNA molecules, and
 circular genomes of bacteria, chloroplast, and mitochondria. One can
 also cluster climate data along any given longitude or latitude. The
 algorithms offer a general high-performance solution to circular and
 framed data clustering.
